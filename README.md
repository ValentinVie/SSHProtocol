# CSE 543 - Fall 2018 - Project 1: SSH File Transfer
In this project, you will develop a client-server system that provides secure file transfer. You will implement the SSH protocol to construct a secure channel between the client and server over which to perform secure file transfer. You will use the OpenSSL library to implement the SSH protocol. The SSH protocol produces a symmetric key shared between the client and server, and you will use the OpenSSL library once again to use that key to transfer the file.

My code is in the file `cse543-proto.c`.
